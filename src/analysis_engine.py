    # To make the example usage runnable, we need to ensure that the imports work.
    # This typically means the 'src' directory needs to be on the Python path,
    # or we need to adjust the import statements for direct script execution.
    # For a simple stub, we might not be able to run this directly without
    # setting up the PYTHONPATH or running as a module.
    # However, the class definition itself is the primary goal.
    
    # Mocking the imports for the sake of the __main__ block example,
    # as direct execution of this file might not resolve them correctly
    # without further project structure setup (e.g. __init__.py in indicators)
